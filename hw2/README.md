Homework 2

I am using 1 late day on this assignment. 

I did not complete the verbose output for part 3, but I did detect the number
of V's supplied as arguments. Everything else should work as intended, even on
Sparky, unless I missed something in my test cases. I'm slightly worried about
converting from UTF-16BE to UTF-8. There was an off by one error in my test cases
that I think fixed but doesn't make any sense to me as to why that would fix it. 
I thought it was rather odd that that error showed up in the first place as it
worked almost exactly the same as converting UTF-16LE to UTF-8, but I digress.
